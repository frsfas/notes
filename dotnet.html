->The .NET Framework is an environment for building, deploying, and running Web Services and other applications. 
It consists of three main parts: the Common Language Runtime, the Framework classes, and ASP.NET.
->VB.NET, C#, COBOL and Perl, etc. .net Supports More than 44 languages.
->application servers are IIS (Microsoft), WebLogic Server (BEA), JBoss (Red Hat), WebSphere (IBM).

1.Main components of .NET framework
    .NET framework consists of 2 main components. They are:

    Common Language Runtime- 
        It is an execution engine that runs the code and provides services that make the development process
        easier.
    Framework Class Library- 
        It has pre-defined methods and properties to implement common 
        and complex functions that can be used by .NET applications.

2.How does the .NET framework work?
    ->.NET framework-based applications that are written in supportive languages like C#, F#, 
        or Visual basic are compiled to Common Intermediate Language (CIL).
    ->Compiled code is stored in the form of an assembly file that has a .dll or .exe file extension.
        When the .NET application runs, Common Language Runtime (CLR) takes the assembly file 
        and converts the CIL into machine code with the help of the Just In Time(JIT) compiler.
    ->Now, this machine code can execute on the specific architecture of the computer it is running on.

    SOURCE CODE->NATIVE COMPILER->CIL->CLR->EXECUTABLE CODE

1. What is CTS?
    CTS stands for Common Type System. It follows a set of structured rules according to which 
    a data type should be declared and used in the program code. 
    It is used to describe all the data types that are going to be used in the application.
        
    We can create our own classes and functions by following the rules in the CTS.
    It helps in calling the data type declared in one programming language by other programming languages

2. Explain CLS
    Common Language Specification (CLS) helps the application developers to use the components 
    that are inter-language compatible with certain rules that come with CLS.
    It also helps in reusing the code among all of the .NET-compatible languages.

3. What is JIT?
    JIT stands for Just In Time. It is a compiler that converts the intermediate code 
    into the native language during the execution.

4. What is the difference between int and Int32?
    There is no difference between int and Int32. Int32 is a type provided by the .NET framework class
     whereas int is an alias name for Int32 in the C# programming language.
    
5. Explain the differences between value type and reference type.
    The main differences between value type and reference type are given below:
    
    ->A Value Type holds the actual data directly within the memory location and a reference type contains 
    a pointer which consists of the address of another memory location that holds the actual data.
    ->Value type stores its contents on the stack memory and reference type stores its contents 
    on the heap memory.
    ->Assigning a value type variable to another variable will copy the value directly and assigning 
    a reference variable to another doesn’t copy the value, instead, it creates a second copy of 
    the reference.
    Predefined data types, structures, enums are examples of value types. Classes, Objects,
     Arrays, Indexers, Interfaces, etc are examples of reference types.

6. What is the difference between managed and unmanaged code?
     The main difference between managed and unmanaged code is listed below:
     
     Managed Code	                        Unmanaged Code
     It is managed by CLR.	
                                    It is not managed by CLR.
     .NET framework is a must for execution.	
                        Does not require a .NET framework for the execution.
     Memory management is done through garbage collection.	
                                Runtime environment takes care of memory management.

7. Explain Microsoft Intermediate Language
    MSIL is the Microsoft Intermediate Language, which provides instructions for calling methods,
    memory handling, storing and initializing values, exception handling, and so on.
                                
    The instructions provided by MSIL are platform-independent and are generated by the 
    language-specific compiler from the source code. 
    JIT compiler compiles the MSIL into machine code based on the requirement.

8. What is an assembly?
    An assembly is a file that is automatically generated by the compiler which consists of a 
    collection of types and resources that are built to work together and form a logical unit of
     functionality. We can also say, assembly is a compiled code and logical unit of code.
    
    Assemblies are implemented in the form of executable (.exe) or dynamic link library (.dll) files.

9. Is ASP.NET different from ASP? If yes, explain how?
    Yes, ASP.NET and ASP(Active Server Pages) both are different. 
    Let’s check how they are different from each other.
    
    ->ASP.NET uses .NET languages such as C# and VB.NET, which are compiled to 
        Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL). ASP uses VBScript. ASP code is interpreted 
        during the execution.
    ->ASP.NET which is developed by Microsoft is used to create dynamic web applications
         while ASP is Microsoft’s server-side technology used to create web pages.
    ->ASP.NET is fully object-oriented but ASP is partially object-oriented.
    ->ASP.NET has full XML Support for easy data exchange whereas ASP has no built-in support for XML.
    ->ASP.NET uses the ADO.NET technology to connect and work with databases. ASP uses ADO technology.

10.Explain MVC.
    MVC stands for Model View Controller. It is an architecture to build .NET applications.
    Following are three main logical components of MVC: the model, the view, and the controller.
   
11. What is the meaning of CAS in .NET?
    Code Access Security(CAS) is necessary to prevent unauthorized access to programs and 
    resources in the runtime.
     It is designed to solve the issues faced when obtaining code from external sources,
    
12.What is the difference between an abstract class and an interface?
     The main difference between an abstract class and an interface are listed below:
     
     Abstract Class	                                                Interface

    ->Used to declare properties, events, methods, 
     and fields as well.	                                Fields cannot be declared using interfaces.
    ->Provides the partial implementation of 
     functionalities that must be implemented by
      inheriting classes.	                         Used to declare the behavior of an implementing class.
    ->Different kinds of access modifiers like private, 
     public, protected, etc. are supported.	            Only public access modifier is supported.
    ->It can contain static members.	                        It does not contain static members.
    ->Multiple inheritances cannot be achieved.          	Multiple inheritances are achieved.

13.What are the types of memories supported in the .NET framework?
    Two types of memories are present in .NET. They are:
    
    Stack: Stack is a stored-value type that keeps track of each executing thread and its location. 
    It is used for static memory allocation.
    
    Heap: Heap is a stored reference type that keeps track of the more precise objects or data.
     It is used for dynamic memory allocation.

14.Explain localization and globalization.
     Localization is the process of customizing our application to behave as per the current 
     culture and locale.
     
     Globalization is the process of designing the application so that it can be used by users 
     from across the globe by supporting multiple languages.

15.What are MDI and SDI?
     MDI (Multiple Document Interface): An MDI allows you to open multiple windows, 
     it will have one parent window and as many child windows.
     The components are shared from the parent window like toolbar, menubar, etc.
     
     SDI (Single Document Interface): SDI opens each document in a separate window. 
     Each window has its own components like a toolbar, menubar, etc. 
     Therefore it is not constrained to the parent window.

     What is an EXE and a DLL?
     EXE and DLLs are assembly executable modules.
     
     EXE is an executable file that runs the application for which it is designed. 
     An EXE is produced when we build an application. 
     Therefore the assemblies are loaded directly when we run an EXE. 
     However, an EXE cannot be shared with the other applications.
     
     Dynamic Link Library (DLL) is a library that consists of code that needs to be hidden. 
     The code is encapsulated inside this library. 
     An application can consist of many DLLs which can be shared with the other programs and applications.

16.What are security controls available on ASP.NET?
     Following are the five security controls available on ASP.NET:
     
     <asp: Login> Provides a login capability that enables the users to enter their credentials with ID and password fields.
     <asp: LoginName> Used to display the user name who has logged-in.
     <asp: LoginView> Provides a variety of views depending on the template that has been selected.
     <asp: LoginStatus> Used to check whether the user is authenticated or not.
     <asp: PasswordRecovery> Sends an email to a user while resetting the password.

17.What is MIME in .NET?
    MIME stands for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions. It is the extension of the e-mail protocol 
    which lets users use the protocol to exchange files over emails easily.

18.Explain different types of cookies available in ASP.NET?
    Two types of cookies are available in ASP.NET. They are:
    
    Session Cookie: It resides on the client machine for a single session and is valid until the user logs 
    out.
    Persistent Cookie: It resides on the user machine for a period specified for its expiry. 
    It may be an hour, a day, a month, or never.

What is a component?
-->
Component is a group of logically related classes and methods. A component is a class that implements the IComponent interface or uses a class that implements IComponent interface.

What is a control?
-->
A control is a component that provides user-interface (UI) capabilities.

What are design patterns?
-->
Design patterns are common solutions to common design problems.

What is a connection pool?
-->
A connection pool is a ‘collection of connections’ which are shared between the clients requesting one. Once the connection is closed, it returns back to the pool. This allows the connections to be reused.

What is a flat file?
-->
A flat file is the name given to text, which can be read or written only sequentially.

What is the global assembly cache (GAC)?
-->
GAC is a machine-wide cache of assemblies that allows .NET applications to share libraries. 
GAC solves some of the problems associated with dll’s (DLL Hell).
