it is a process used to identify the correctness , completeness and quality to develop computer software

its the process of executing a program/application under positive and negative conditions 
by manual or automated means it checks
    ->specification
    ->functionality
    ->performance

error:  its a human action that produces the incorrect result that produces a functionality

bug: the presence of error at the time of execution of the software

fault: state of software caused by an error

failure: deviation of  the software from its expected result its an events

                    TESTING METHOLOGY

BLACKBOX TESTING:no knowledge of internal program design or code required
                    tests are based on requirements and functionality

WHITEBOX TESTING: knowledge of the internal program design and code required
                    test are based on coverage of code statement,branches , paths and conditions


                    TESTING level

unit testing:   tests each modules individually , follow a white box testing(logic of the program) 
                done by developers

integration testing:    once all the modules have been unit tested , integration testing is performed
                        its systematic testing , produces test to identify errors associate with interfacing 
                        types: big bang integration testing top dowm integration testing button up integration testing

system testing: the system as a whole is tested to uncover requirment errors ,
 verifies that all system elements work properly and that overall system function and performance has 
 been achieved , types: alpha testing , beta testing , acceptance testing , performance testing
